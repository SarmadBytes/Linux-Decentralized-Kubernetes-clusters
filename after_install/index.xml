      <description>Kubernetes Upgrades can be triggered from Kubernetes with system-upgrade-controller installed in your cluster. See the cOS documentation
Manual Upgrade to latest Upgrades can be triggered manually as well from the nodes.
To upgrade to latest available version, run c3os upgrade.
To specify a version, run c3os upgrade &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;. Use --force to force upgrading to avoid checking versions. All the available versions can be list with: c3os upgrade list-releases.
It is possible altough to use the same commandset from cOS.</description>

Get kubeconfig On all nodes of the cluster it&amp;rsquo;s possible to invoke c3os get-kubeconfig to recover the kubeconfig file

      <description>c3os is a container-based OS, if you want to change c3os and add a package it is required to build only a docker image.
For example:
FROMquay.io/c3os/c3os:opensuse-latestRUN zypper in -y ...RUN export VERSION=&amp;#34;my-version&amp;#34;RUN envsubst &amp;#39;${VERSION}&amp;#39; &amp;lt;/etc/os-releaseThe image can be then used with c3os upgrade or with system-upgrade-controller for upgrades within Kubernetes.</description>
